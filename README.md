Made in 2 days, so there are still some rough edges, but it's working nicely!

## Frontend stack

TypeScript + Vite + SvelteKit + Tailwind CSS + Drizzle + Postgres.js + Arctic + Zod + Serwist + others

_(the first time I've used Drizzle and Arctic, and damn they're so much fun!)_

## Backend stack (ML Model)

Python + Flask + PIL + others
